    1.Angular is a modular based architecture.
        -There is a lot of modules which are built-in
        Examples:

            -BrowserAnimationModule

        -Angular Material library
            -MatButtonModule
            -MatDropDownModule

        @NgModule
        what module consists -
            -declarations
                -this is where we will add all the components of the module.
            -imports
                -we can import modules inside a module.
            -providers
                -services that we need will be injected here.    
            -bootstrap
                -what is the first component ,that module should load.
            -exports
                -It is to export and expose the component outside of the module. 
    4.Every angular application should have atleast 1 module.
    5.By default,the angular framework provide us with Appmodule. 
    6.Whenever we are building an angular application   
        -we will always think of modules first.
    7.Feature Modules.
        -you can turn on or turn off the modules based on conditions.
    
    Angular components
    ------------------
    1.Angular components are the most important and basic building blocks of angular apps
    2.Authentication Module
        -new user
        -login
        -forgot password
        -reset password

    3.Component is a small functionality that will implement your application.
    
    4.When we group multiple components together it will became a module.

    5.We can have parent-child relationship of components.

    6. we can have components inside components.

    7.Every component has 4 files auto-generated with it.
        component.html -> view or html or template file.
        component.css   -> StyleSheet of the component
        component.spec.ts -> It will have unit test script for component
        component.ts -> It will be a class file which will have methods -> Logic

    8.component decorator inside component.ts file
        selector -> unique identifier for the component.
            ->id of the component
        templateUrl -> your html code
            -component.html file
        styleURLs -> for linking your component style sheet.
            -component.css file
